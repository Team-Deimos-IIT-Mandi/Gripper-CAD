## ü§ñ Gripper Overview

This gripper is designed for **independent claw control** using rack-and-pinion actuation, with each claw powered by its own motor. The system is optimized for modularity, compliance, and terrain adaptability.

---

## üîß Key Features

### 1. **Core Actuation: Parallel Gripper**
- Simple, robust parallel motion
- Modular design for easy integration with the rover arm

### 2. **Vertical Mobility**
- Each claw can move **up and down independently**
- Vertical motion decoupled from gripping action

### 3. **Hart‚Äôs Linkage**
- Ensures **pure vertical motion** of the fingertip
- Spring provides compliance and energy storage
- Mechanical stop prevents over-extension

### 4. **Parallelogram Linkage**
- Maintains **parallel orientation** of the fingertip
- Enables stable, line-based contact with objects

### 5. **Scooping Capability**
- Fingertip can **passively tilt** into a scooping pose
- Roller joint contacts the ground for smooth sliding
- Transitions from pinching to scooping seamlessly

### 6. **Finger Plate Design**
- Holes in the plate likely serve **weight reduction** and **manufacturing ease**

## üß† Design Philosophy

This gripper embodies a balance of **mechanical simplicity**, **functional versatility**, and **field reliability**. Every linkage and motion path is chosen to ensure robust performance in Martian terrain, while remaining easy to manufacture and maintain.
